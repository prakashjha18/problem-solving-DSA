There is a Giant who is exhausted. To gain strength he will go through a N*M integer grid Arr[N][M] which contains 
food packets. Arr[i][j] is the amount of strength he gains after eating the food packet. Strength gained by eating 
a food packet can also be negative( i.e. Arr[i][j]<0). From row r and column c, he can go to any of the following 
three indices:

I.                Arr[ r+1 ][ c-1 ] (valid only if c-1>=0)
II.               Arr[ r+1 ][ c ]
III.              Arr[ r+1 ][ c+1 ] (valid only if c+1<=N-1)

So if he start at any column on row 0, what is the maximum strength he can earn till row N-1. If the strength
earned is negative print 0, because in that case he will not enter the grid.

Note: If Giant is standing at Arr[i][j] he has to eat that food packet .

Input:
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains 
two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and columns. Next N lines of each test case contains M space 
seperated integers denoting amount of strength he gains after eating the food packet .

Output:
Print the maximum strength the giant can gain.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10
1<=N,M<=1000
0<=| Arr[i][j] |<=105
Sum of N*M over all test cases doesn't exceed 106

Your Task:â€‹
This is a functional problem . You don't need to take input just complete the function strength()
which accpets 2d vector grid and two integers N , M as parameters and return the maximum strength giant can gain.

Example:
Input:
2
2 2
10 4
3 5
2 2
5 -1
-2 -1
Output:
15
4

Explanation:
Testcase 1: He will eat 10 in 1st row and 5 in second row.
Testcase 2: He will eat 5 in 1st row and -1 in second row.
